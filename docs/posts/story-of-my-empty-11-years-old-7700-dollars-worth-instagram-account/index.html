    <div class="post-content">
      
      <p>Today I had to login into my old mailbox. It was probably one of the first email addresses I&rsquo;ve ever had as a kid.</p>
<p>I noticed, drowning in an ocean of spam, some emails from Instagram. Someone tried to reset my password several times.</p>
<p>This also reminds me that I have an Instagram account.
I first discovered the existence of my IG account few years ago while checking this same obsolete inbox. That time the email was different. It was a warning stating that if I didn&rsquo;t logged in within a short period of time then my account may be deactivated.
I didn&rsquo;t care much because I&rsquo;ve never really used Instagram, so I ignored it.</p>
<p>But this time‚Ä¶ is different. Someone is trying to reset my password. Do they want to break into my account? My Software-Engineer-Spider-Sense tells me there is something. Even if the account is empty I don&rsquo;t want it to be hacked.
Plus, I chose the password when I was 20 and stupid. The password is for sure something guessable, and the combination <code>&lt;obsolete-mail, stupid-password&gt;</code> is likely a match on <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I Been Pwned</a>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go updating the password with something decent. After some tries I spot the correct one and I&rsquo;m in. Good, it seems no one hacked the account, or at least no one changed the password before me. I use Google Chrome to generate a new shiny random password.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s check the <code>obsolete-mail</code> on HIBP. Two breaches:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dropbox: email address, password</strong> (salted SHA-1)<br>
<strong>8Tracks: email address, password</strong> (salted SHA-1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As expected.</p>
<p>Now back to the Instagram account. I feel immediately disoriented by the platform. I follow no one and my profile is empty, so the UI is full of call to actions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Find your friends!<br>
Add a profile picture!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They are trying to engage me in the system. Their purpose is to move some user engagement business KPIs defined somewhere in California.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not completely blank.</p>
<p>I have 100 stranger followers and I have 2 pictures.<br>
Apparently, when I registered in 2011 I uploaded two photos before quitting immediately.
The photos are quite insignificant and they have that vintage effect that was popular at that time.<br>
There are some comments, though.</p>
<p>I immediately notice that almost every person that left a comment during all these years has a username similar to mine.</p>
<p>They are asking me to give them my username. My username is simpler compared to their one. Has only four letters, no symbols or digits. Just a simple, lowercase, four letter word.</p>
<p>Someone is mad at me because I took his real life nickname and then I never used Instagram.</p>
<p>There is one guy that tagged the official <code>@Instagram</code> account reporting that I am inactive. Also in this case, my username is a substring of his one.</p>
<p>Apparently my early, super-short experience with Instagram gave me the chance to choose a special username.</p>
<p>And then there are these two guys performing an auction:</p>
<p><img src="/img/instagram-username-auction-redacted.jpg" alt="Instagram username bid" title="Instagram username bid"></p>
<p>Ok, ok, I know that you can find the conversation with a little research, but I enjoyed redacting their so precious nickname üòÇ.<br>
The point is, are they willing to pay real money for a username on a social media? I genuinely hope that they are joking.</p>
<p>But this conversation reminds me that, yes, there exist people on the Internet able to do strange things just to get a special username on a platform. They have an obsession with owning early or unusual names. They call them ‚ÄúOG‚Äù accounts, short for ‚Äúoriginal gangster‚Äù.</p>
<p>I learnt about this in the summer of 2020 when Twitter suffered a <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/07/whos-behind-wednesdays-epic-twitter-hack/">social engineering attack</a> that had a lot of media visibility.
Some celebrity accounts like Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk posted a Bitcoin scam stating that they were going to send back the amount received on a wallet, but doubled.<br>
It turns out that the origin of the attack had a different purpose. Some kids gained access to Twitter&rsquo;s administrative tools so that they could take over fancy usernames and reselling later, or show them off to their friends.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ll do with my original gangster Instagram account? I don&rsquo;t know, i&rsquo;ll probably leave it empty but aging like a whiskey in oak casks. One day I could be millionaire, or most probably, it will be deleted for inactivity.</p>
