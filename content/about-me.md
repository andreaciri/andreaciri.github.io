### Hey there!

I'm an Italian software engineer working at [Subito](https://www.subito.it).

I wanted to start this blog to share some ideas about software development in a tech company, but also for personal projects and random thoughts.

I like the idea that someone can stumble across one of my posts and find it somehow useful.

Reach me out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreaciri/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/andreaciri).
