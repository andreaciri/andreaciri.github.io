### Hey there!

I'm a software engineer working at [Subito](https://www.subito.it).

I wanted to start this blog to share some ideas about software development and my work in a tech company.

I spent half of my life reading and learning stuff on the Internet. I love technology and knowledge sharing. I like the idea that someone can read my posts and find them somehow useful.
